Quick Examples:

1. Validating the ORDS schema for cerndb1
    java -jar /work-dir/artifacts/ords/wars/ords.war validate --database cerndb1

2. Change the default caching configuration to disabled
    java -jar /work-dir/artifacts/ords/wars/ords.war set-property cache.caching true

3. Create or update an user named ords_admin with role Listener Administrator
    java -jar /work-dir/artifacts/ords/wars/ords.war user ords_admin "Listener Administrator"

4.  Install or upgrade Oracle REST Data Services schema, proxy user and related database objects.
    java -jar /work-dir/artifacts/ords/wars/ords.war schema

Note: It's best to run this Docker image from inside of the CERN network.

    -----ORDS Managment Quickstart-------
    Here's how to manage ORDS installations in 5 simple steps:
    1. SSH into dbadm
        ssh dbadm
    2. Retrieve the DadEdit3 database password. Copy it.
        get_passwd password_dadedit3_cerndb1
    3. From your machine, run the docker container, specifying the service you want to manage (APEX, ORAWEB, ORDS, APEX-SSO, ORAWEB-SSO... - for a full list run the container without specifying the service):
        docker run --rm -it -e SERVICE_NAME=ORDS gitlab-registry.cern.ch/jeedy/utils/ords-config-image:2.2 /bin/bash
    4. You will be asked for dadEdit3 database password. Paste the password.
    5. Et voil√†! Now you should be able to interact with ORDS

    ------Interacting with ORDS-----------
    Location of the ords.war 
        For convenience the ords.war is linked in /work-dir/artifacts/ords/wars. Its original default location is /ORA/dbs01/syscontrol/local/dadEdit/wars
    Location of the config files
        Like the war file, config files are linked in /work-dir/artifacts/ords/ords/<<SERVICE_NAME>>/conf. Orignal location: /ORA/dbs01/syscontrol/local/dadEdit/ords/ords/<<SERVICE_NAME>>/conf

    To display a full list of available commands, go to the directory or folder containing the ords.war file and execute the following command:
        java -jar /work-dir/artifacts/ords/wars/ords.war help
    A list of the available commands is displayed. To see instructions on how to use each of these commands, enter help followed by the command name, for example:
        java -jar /work-dir/artifacts/ords/wars/ords.war help configdir

    Validating the schemas
        You can test all the schemas quickly by running script:
            /ORA/dbs01/syscontrol/projects/dadEdit3/bin/test_all_schemas
        If you run it from a host which doesn't have access to the Technical Network, some of the DADs might appear incorrect in that case. 

    Accessing DAD data 
        If you want to manually check a single DAD, go to the config files directory and find .xml file that corresponds to the DAD that interests you. 
        Inside you will find credentials that can be e.g. tested through sqlplus.
